## Question

What is the Angular API of Yeti's `columns` layout, and what does its spec say? Its decisions are already made in the records: its row in `building-blocks.md` Part 2 (and the "Aria decisions" section where it applies), its rows in [Decide: how the package maps each of Yeti's `data-*` attributes](26-decide-yeti-data-attributes-mapping.md), its item file under [ADR 0060](../adr/0060-item-styles-are-counted-links-to-the-consumers-yeti-build.md), its ledger rows, and the shared specs it links to.

## How to work it

Write `specs/columns.md` with the `/to-spec` template and the map's Spec shape note, from the records only. The spec decides nothing a record has not decided. Anything it needs and no record settles goes under the ticket's `### Open` for the orchestrator. Append an `## Answer` that links the spec.
